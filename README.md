# Assembly and Architecture
A series of MASM programs I wrote for my Architecture and Assembly course at Oregon State University. MASM is an Assembly Language for x86 Processors. This is what your CPU interprets when you write a piece of code in a programming language like C++, Python, or Java and is translated by the compiler. This course taught me how computers process our programs on the lowest level. My understanding informs the way I think about programming in terms of instructions, speed, and efficiency. 

The programs can be run in Visual Studio 2019 with MASM.
